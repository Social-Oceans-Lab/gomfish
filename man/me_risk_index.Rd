\description{
A composite daily risk index, which describes the relative risk level of conditions at sea by zone and day from 2010-2021. The risk index was created by first calculating 12 hour daily averages of wind speed, wind gusts, air temperature, significant wave height, and wave period. Then, we conducted a principal component analysis to determine appropriate weighting for each weather component, resulting in a single value per zone and day.
